            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

That the Exciſe being laid upon the Brewers, and thereupon the price of <hi>Ale</hi> being raiſed which is payed to the Vintner, it is juſt and reaſonable that the Brewer ſhould be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to raiſe his price proportionally, as was done when the <hi>Ale</hi> was cryed up formerly to <hi>two ſhill,</hi> the <hi>pint</hi> otherwiſe the Ventner will reap the whole Benefit, and the Brewers carry the whole Burden, which is humbly conceived was never the Deſign of the <hi>Act of Parliament.</hi> 2. If the Neighbouring Vintners in <hi>Abby,</hi> Yeard-heads of <hi>Leith, Caldtown,</hi> and other adjacent Places to the Petitioners, ſhould take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them to ſell their <hi>Ale</hi> at <hi>two ſhill, per pint,</hi> being ſo near and contiguous to the Petitioners, the ſamen will not only evacuat the Deſign of the <hi>Act of Parliament,</hi> by drawing all the Conſumpt to them. But like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe will tend to the Petitioners ruine, and ſo conſequently to his Majeſties loſs, which is hoped their Lordſhips will take into their conſideration: And therefore humbly Supplicating, to the effect under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writen, as the ſaid Supplication bears. The ſaids Lords of his Majeſties Privy Council do hereby Ordain and Allow the Supplicants to raiſe the price of all <hi>Ale</hi> to be vented and ſold within the Burgh of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> Sub-urbs and Liberties thereof, and Yeard-heads of <hi>Leith</hi> proportionally, as the Vintners are allowed to raiſe the ſame: and diſcharges the Neighbouring Ventners within the <hi>Abby,</hi> the Yeard-heads of <hi>Leith, Caldcoun</hi> and other adjacent Places to the Petitioners, to ſell their <hi>Ale</hi> at a lower rate, than the price appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Petitioners, with, and under the ſame Certification and Penalty appointed to Vintners within Burgh: and appoints thir preſents to be printed and publiſhed at the Mercat Croſs of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and other places needful.</p>
